Hi,

Thanks for looking at this.

Sure prandom_u32_state() should have a similar effect being a bit 
slower, and a bit better due to the extra hidden state.

There isn't anything wrong with get_random_u16 from a kstack 
randomization standpoint, except for the latency spikes of course.

As I mentioned in the other email, benchmark is probably the wrong word. 
Its a better QoS response time distributions for a given workload. And 
its not strictly in RT kernel latency test types of things, but normal 
memcached style workloads on !RT kernels as well.
